# What is «IsRespo»?
*IsRespo* is a simple tool that allows us to test a webpage responsiveness on different devices: desktops, tablets, smartphones and so on.
The application is open source being licensed under the MIT License.

# Simple and Beautiful
Combining the flat design with the power of HTML5 and CSS3, *IsRepo* is perfect for simulating quickly the responsiveness of your web page or web application.

# Limitations
There are few limitations:

 - The web page is still loaded in an `iframe`. That's why we will not be able to test responsiveness for the sites that send `X-Frame-Options:deny` header.
 - This application uses only the client side, so if the device handling is done on the server side the desktop version will be loaded.
